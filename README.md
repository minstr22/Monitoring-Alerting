## Monitoring-Alerting With Prometheus And Grafana
# A Prometheus & Grafana docker-compose stack

Here's a quick start using Play-With-Docker (PWD) to start-up a [Prometheus](http://prometheus.io/) stack containing Prometheus, Grafana and Node scraper to monitor your Docker infrastructure. The Try in PWD below allows you to quickly deploy the entire Prometheus stack with a click of the button. This will allow you to quickly test the stack to see if it meets your needs.
# Pre-requisites
Before we get started installing the Prometheus stack. Ensure you install the latest version of docker and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on your Docker host machine.
